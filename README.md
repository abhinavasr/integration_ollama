# OpenAI integration in Nextcloud

:warning: The smart pickers have been removed from this app
as they are now included in the [Assistant app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/assistant).

This app implements:

* Text generation providers: Free prompt, Summarize, Headline and Reformulate (using any available large language model)
* A Translation provider (using any available language model)
* A SpeechToText provider (using Whisper)
* An image generation provider

Instead of connecting to the OpenAI API for these, you can also connect to a self-hosted [LocalAI](https://localai.io) instance
or to any service that implements an API similar to the OpenAI one, for example: [Plusserver](https://www.plusserver.com/en/ai-platform/).

## Ethical AI Rating
### Rating for Text generation using ChatGPT via OpenAI API: 🔴

Negative:
* the software for training and inference of this model is proprietary, limiting running it locally or training by yourself
* the trained model is not freely available, so the model can not be run on-premises
* the training data is not freely available, limiting the ability of external parties to check and correct for bias or optimise the model's performance and CO2 usage.


### Rating for Translation using ChatGPT via OpenAI API: 🔴

Negative:
* the software for training and inference of this model is proprietary, limiting running it locally or training by yourself
